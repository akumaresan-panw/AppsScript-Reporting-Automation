            <p class="paragraph">
                Before your Apps Script project can work its magic, it needs permission to interact with your Google files.
                When setting up a new Apps Script project, you will be prompted to grant authorization. Click "Review permissions" to proceed.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Then, you will be asked to allow access to your Google Account. Click "Continue" to grant the necessary permissions.

                The automation journey begins once you've identified the recurring slides in your presentations.
                Your next step is to collaborate with Gemini, prompting it to generate the specific Apps Script code
                that will power your automation, all based on the templates you define.

                This vital function ensures that your Apps Script initializes correctly and builds the necessary data

                <li class="list-item"><strong>Empower Gemini:</strong> Once your placeholders are meticulously defined, feed them into Gemini. The more structured and clear your templates, the more accurately Gemini will generate the Apps Script code you need.</li>

            <p class="paragraph">
                <strong class="font-semibold text-red-600">IMPORTANT:</strong> Always verify that your Google Sheet ID, Google Slides ID, and the exact sheet name for your data are accurately provided within the code generated by Gemini. These variables are crucial for the script to locate and interact with your documents. The Apps Script code will require your Spreadsheet ID and the exact Sheet Name for your data. Ensure these are accurately provided, as shown in the example below.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>"Hello Gemini. Please generate the complete Google Apps Script code for my automated reporting pipeline.

Sheet Name for Data: “QBR Data” (actual name of sheet within sheets document)

Commentary Block 1:
Commentary Name: NAM OPEX and HC
Slides Placeholder: [NAM_OPEX_HC_PLACEHOLDER]
Sheet Output Cell: C41
Data Mapping:
opexAmount: G41, "Total OPEX for the quarter"
headcount: G42, "Current headcount"
Output Text Template: "North America OPEX for the quarter was opexAmount with a headcount of headcount."
AI Analysis Rule:
Rule: Flag for review if opexAmount is greater than $3.5M

Commentary Block 2:
Commentary Name: Trending Discount
Slides Placeholder: [TRENDING_DISCOUNT_PLACEHOLDER]
Sheet Output Cell: C31
Data Mapping: avgDiscount: G31, "The average discount rate"
Output Text Template: "The average discount rate for the quarter was avgDiscount."
AI Analysis Rule:
Rule: Flag for review if avgDiscount is greater than 22%.

(Add as many commentaries as you need, if your deck has 5 replicable slides period over period, include all 5 formatted like above)
